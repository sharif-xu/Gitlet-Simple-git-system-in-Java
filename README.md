This is Project #3 for CS61B Spring2020, without skeleton code. **Only for Educational use!**  Do not copy even for due days😊, Believe in yourself. You can make it.🦾🦾🦾

In this project you'll be implementing a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. Ours is smaller and simpler, however, so we have named it Gitlet.

A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

1. Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called *committing*, and the saved contents themselves are called *commits*.
2. Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called *checking out* those files or that commit.
3. Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the *log*.
4. Maintaining related sequences of commits, called *branches*.
5. Merging changes made in one branch into another.

You can find design-document in the same root named gitlet-design.md file.
